## Hic Sunt Leones 🦁
> “That the great moments in the struggle of individuals form a chain, that in them the high points of humanity are linked throughout millennia, but what is highest in such a moment of the distant past be for me still alive, bright and great — this is the fundamental thought of the faith in humanity which is expressed in demand for a monumental history. Precisely this demand however, that the great be eternal, occasions the most terrible conflict. For all else which also lives cries no. The monumental ought not arise — that is the counter-watch-word. Dull habit, the small and lowly which fills all corners of the world and wafts like a dense earthly vapour around everything great, deceiving, smothering and suffocating, obstructs the path which the great must still travel to immortality.”
> －Friedrich Nietzsche, `“Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der Historie für das Leben”` (written in 1874 as part of his `“Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen”`)
