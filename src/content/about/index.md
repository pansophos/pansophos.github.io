B.F. Griffith is just another middle-aged nerdy intellectual with too many hobbies and never enough time for them all; he’s a verbose, sardonic, discerning, skeptical, and sometimes cynical iconoclast－but also a convivial, amiable, voluptuary, and humanistic Epicurean. As a former history teacher and longtime student of philosophy with a keen interest in historiography, he spends much of his free time happily dwelling in the past (or in fantastical worlds of his own imagining), and he is an insatiable bibliophile. 📖♥️
