For the purposes of this copyright＆license, “author(s)” shall be defined as the following set of individuals:
* Benjamin Forbes Griffith
* Diana Christine Griffith
* anyone else who may author (whether in whole or in part) at least one “guest” or collaborative page or creative display or written “post” (or who may provide any significant original open source code contributions to this repository) which B.F. Griffith (at his sole discretion) may approve for merging onto the main branch of this repository (and thus consent to publish indefinitely＆deploy to any part of the pansophos.github.io GitHub Pages website)
* Any contributing authors may choose which contact info or social links they may wish to share along with their contributions. Any update requests to these or removal requests for any associated hyperlinks due to any problems with them must be made to the webmasters of this site in writing, at which point every effort will be made to correct the issue in a reasonably timely manner…
* Nevertheless, content submitted to the webmasters of this site along with written permission to publish that content or content submitted to this website as a pull request does constitute non-exclusive legal consent to publish that material as duly attributed guest content on the pansophos.github.io GitHub Pages website for a perpetual and irrevocable duration, unless a specific limited duration is designated in written agreement prior to publication. However, the author(s) of any guest content or creative Works of any sort published on the pansophos.github.io GitHub Pages website retain＆reserve all rights to ownership as well as to authorize at their sole discretion other publications elsewhere of that content or creative Work. Any publication agreements with this website are non-exclusive!
Furthermore, out of esteem for the reserved rights of any guest authors or artists who may choose to publish content on the pansophos.github.io GitHub Pages website, the webmasters of this site will respectfully consider any removal requests regarding authorized publications those authors’ content, but shall be under no legal obligation to complete any such requests within any specific timeframe once that content has already been submitted＆published (on the pansophos.github.io GitHub Pages website only) with the aforementioned perpetual＆irrevocable permission of the author(s), either in writing or by approved＆merged pull-request.

This repository’s functional＆stylistic open source Astro.js, HTML markup, and customized styling code as well as its reserved creative／written content is provided “as-is” — without any express or implied warranty or guarantee of fitness for any purpose. In no event will its author(s) be held liable for ANY direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages which may arise from any use of this repository or its source-code or substantive contents, regardless of whether or not anyone is advised of the possibility of any such damage(s) whatsoever.

Permission is hereby granted to anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute any functional or stylistic (rather than substantive creative Works content) portions of this repository’s source-code for any non-commercial／nonprofit applications or purposes whatsoever, as well as to alter those portions or redistribute them freely, without fee, subject to the following restrictions:

1. The authorship of any original (non dependency library subject to its own terms) unique or distinctive substantive written content (non-code) portions of this repository’s source-code must not be misrepresented; no person or persons other than the author(s) may falsely claim that they wrote any customized or bespoke portions of this repository’s written contents or published uniquely creative Works without citing proper attribution. If anyone other than the author(s) do clone＆repurpose any significant portions of this repository’s code for any non-commercial use, such as to use it as an exemplary “template” to construct a similar Astro.js GitHub pages site by replacing its substantive written＆creative works content with their own, a written acknowledgement or attribution citation＆backlink somewhere in that application’s or website’s documentation would be appreciated as a gracious gesture of artisanal etiquette.
2. Altered source customized versions or repurposed “forks” of this repository’s source-code must be plainly marked as such; they must not, under any circumstances, ever be misrepresented as if they were “original” copies or pristine clones of this repository’s code.
3. Any significant or substantively unique original or customized written or otherwise creative Works portions of this repository and its software (beyond its baseline “Themefisher” Astro.js template available under its own separate MIT license) may NOT ever be used for any commercial or for-profit use(s) or purposes or sold as part of any product or service without express written permission from the author(s) of those particular Works.
4. This notice may not be removed from or altered within any source distribution or offline backup of any portion(s) of this site (beyond its baseline “Themefisher” Astro.js template available at https://github.com/themefisher/bookworm-light-astro/ and subject to its own terms) without express written permission from the author(s).
5. The separate Themefisher MIT licence (also included at the root of this repository) only narrowly applies to, and less restrictively governs, the “Themefisher” template upon which many fundamental aspects of this static GitHub Pages site are based; please respect the terms of that license if you also want to construct a similar GitHub Pages site (or any potentially for-profit Astro.js website) using that baseline scaffolding template as a legally permissable starting-point ( https://github.com/themefisher/bookworm-light-astro/ )…
6. Under the authority of Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution, the rights of the author(s) of any substantive (non-code) documents comprising written or other creative works content of this website to be identified as having authored those Works have been asserted whenever the contents of these files are published into this public GitHub repository, in accordance with the federal Copyright Act.© These “substantive” or semantic written or other creative contents (rather than functional or stylistic “code”) are not legally transferable without consent; all ownership rights thereto are reserved by the author(s). Ergo, no substantive visible written or artistic content portions of these pansophos.github.io publications may be used or reproduced in any unauthorized manner without prior written permission from the author(s) — except in case of brief quotations embodied in critical reviews, scholarly citations, portions already designated as reference documents freely available in the creative commons, or certain other limited noncommercial uses as permitted by copyright law. Any plagiarized reproduction or unauthorized distribution of copyrighted (non-code) written or artistic Works published on this website is illegal; no substantive part of the displayed contents of this website that constitute original Works may be scanned, uploaded, transmitted, or stored in a retrieval system outside of this repository (via the Internet or any other means: electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, print, etc.) without explicit written permission from the author(s) for any permanently stored reproductions beyond the limited scope of private research for intended submissions of prospective contributions to this repository as a duly credited guest author or as personal offline backup cloning of its contents onto your local devices to facilitate offline access for strictly noncommercial purposes.
7. Nevertheless, forks or clones of this open-source repository are permitted＆welcome, with any pull-request approval＋merging into its “main” branch immediately conferring the rights＆privileges of “author” status detailed herein vis-à-vis the particular contents of any specific unique substantive contributions, posts, pages, or other assets in question — but with B.F. Griffith perpetually＆irrevocably maintaining the overall Copyright © for this repository as well as the right to continuously publish on GitHub pages the substantive website contents it generates per the terms of this license, including any contributions by other authors submitted to this repository as pull-requests, approved, and merged.
